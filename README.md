## Why Ted Lasso fortunes?  

__from looper:__
The multiple-Emmy-nominated sitcom "Ted Lasso," about a U.S. Collegiate football coach who is brought to the U.K. to coach a soccer/football team (despite not knowing anything about the U.K., soccer, or ... any of it really) is a heartwarming fish-out-of-water story made all the more delightful by the general disposition of the title character, played by Jason Sudeikis. To a fault, he's an eternally optimistic, supportive, egoless bastion of goodwill and positive energy. His positivity is so infectious it turns nearly everyone in his favor, from the initially critical reporter Trent Crimm of The Independent to team owner Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham), who brought Ted over to tank the team as a petty move to hurt her jerk ex-husband.

Part of this wellspring of positivity and charm is Ted's humorous, pithy, and winning way of speaking. He doesn't lecture, he disarms with funny, whimsical speech that often contains memorable words of wisdom. In fact, Ted's phrases are so ingrained in his character that the short video introducing his character on the show's Apple TV+ page highlights the word "Tedaphor," an original term meaning "a figure of speech in which one understood concept is compared to another; often humorous."
