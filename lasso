Oh, come on, I would not bet on that, unless you want to win a buttload of money.

You know what the happiest animal on Earth is? It’s a goldfish. You know why? Got a ten-second memory. Be a goldfish, Sam.

Jamie Tartt: Coach, I’m me. Why would I want to be anything else?
Ted Lasso: I’m not sure you realize how psychologically healthy that actually is.
%
Hey, takin’ on a challenge is a lot like ridin’ a horse. If you’re comfortable while you’re doin’ it, you’re probably doin’ it wrong.
%
This woman right here is strong, confident, and powerful. Boss, I tell ya, I’d hate to see you and Michelle Obama arm wrestle, but I wouldn’t be able to take my eyes off it, either.
%
Coach Beard: Why you windin’ him up?
Ted Lasso: Because he’s the one, coach. If we’re gonna make an impact here, the first domino needs to fall right inside of that man’s heart.
%
Congrats, you both just met a cool person!

For me, success is not about the wins and losses. It’s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.
%
I like the idea of someone becoming rich because of what they gave to the world, not just because of who their family is.
%
Little girls are mysterious. And silly and powerful. I gave up trying to figure them out years ago.
%
I want you to know, I value each of your opinions, even when you’re wrong. 
%
Our goal is to go out like Willie Nelson – on a high!
%
I believe in hope. I believe in BELIEVE.

Ties and no playoffs? Why do you even do this?
%
In my mind, you gotta have three things to be a Premier League team. One, you gotta play physical, two, you gotta give 100 percent until the final whistle, and three, you gotta be sponsored by a Middle-Eastern airline.
%
Now listen. You two knuckleheads have split our locker room in half and when it comes to locker rooms, I like them just like my mother's bathing suits, I only wanna see 'em in one piece.
%
Will you explain to me how that was offside? No! I’m asking you. Seriously! Explain offside to me. It makes no sense.
%
I think I literally have a better understanding of who killed Kennedy than what is offside. It was the mob.
%
If God would have wanted games to end in a tie, she wouldn’t have invented numbers.

Early drinkin’ means quick drunken.

How many countries are in this country?

That right there, that’s a scone. Tastes like a muffin except it sucks all the spit out of your mouth.
%
Rebecca Welton: Oh, do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
Ted Lasso: I do. But more importantly, I believe they need to believe in themselves.
%
I’m not exactly sure what y’all’s smallest unit of measurement is over here, but that’s about how much headway I made.
%
We’re gonna try it on and see if it fits. It might not. Then again, it might be a very flattering silhouette. I might wear it right out of the store. Makes me feel good, start to strut. Oooh, I like this. I like the way this makes me feel.

Roy, I learned two pretty big lessons on the rough and tumble playgrounds of Bookridge Elementary School. One, if little Ronnie Fouch offers you a candy bar, you immediately say no and get the hell out of there cause there’s a good chance that little son of a gun has pooped inside of a Butterfinger wrapper. No one ever saw him do it, but a couple people ate it. Number two, teacher tells a bully not to pick on someone, it’s just gonna make it worse.

Rebecca Welton: So, I spoke to the owner of The Sun.
Ted Lasso: You spoke to God?!
Rebecca Welton: No, the newspaper.
%
I feel like I just fell out of the lucky tree, hit every branch on the way down, and ended up in a pool of cash and sour patch kids.
%
I’m looking forward to the definition of relegation.
%
Yeah, I’d love to see Abbey Road.
%
If we see each other in our dreams, let’s goof around a little bit, pretend like we don’t know each other.
%
You beating yourself up is like Woody Allen playing the clarinet… I don’t want to hear it!
%
I think if you care about someone and you got a little love in your heart, there ain’t nothin you can’t get through together.
%
I promise you, there is something worse out there than being sad. And that is being alone and being sad. Ain’t no one in this room alone.
%
Don’t let the wisdom of age be wasted on you.
%
Smells like potential.
%
That’s the funny thing about coincidences, ain’t it? Sometimes they just happen.
%
I have a real tricky time hearing folks that don’t believe in themselves.
%
If you would have told me that I’d be drinking tea at three o’clock everyday … about a year ago … I would have punched you in the mouth.
%
Rebecca Welton: How do you take your tea?
Ted Lasso: Well, normally right back to the counter because there’s been a terrible mistake.
%
You know, I always thought that tea was going to taste like hot brown water, and you know what? I was right. It’s horrible.
%
Tea and I are still on a lifelong hiatus.
%
Ain't nobody here going to kiss their sister. Which is an American phrase that I'm now realizing does not exist here, and that's good, because it's creepy.
%
Rebecca Welton: You can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.
Ted Lasso: I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.
%
OK, well, mark this down as the first time we disagree, then. Actually, no, second time. Tea is horrible. Absolute garbage water. Don't know why you all do that.
%
Be honest with me. It's a prank, right? The tea? Like when us tourist folks aren't around, y'all know it tastes like garbage?
%
Yeah, until we get another Nate here, I just need you to assume you're my default Nate.
%
What I can tell you, is with the exception of the wit and wisdom of Calvin and Hobbes, not much lasts forever.
%
For the love of Meghan Markle, do not blow that whistle again.
%
It's just a group of people who care, Roy. Not unlike folks at a hip-hop concert whose hands are not in the air.
%
Seen the Milk sisters anywhere? Want me to go and skim the back room?
